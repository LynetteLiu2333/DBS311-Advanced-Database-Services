-- in September with the most recently hired employees displayed first. 
-- Q1 SOLUTION 
SELECT employee_id AS "Employee Number", 
        first_name || ' ' || last_name as "Full Name", 
        job_title AS "Job Title", 
        TO_CHAR(hire_date, '[Month ddTH" of year "YYYY]') AS "Start Date"
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date LIKE '__SEP__'
ORDER BY hire_date DESC,
        employee_id;

-- *Question#2* The company wants to see the total sale amount per salesperson (salesman) for all orders. 
-- Assume that online orders do not have any sales representative. For online orders (orders with no salesman ID), consider the salesman ID as 0. 
-- Display the salesman ID and the total sale amount for each employee. Sort the result according to employee number.
-- Q2 SOLUTION 
SELECT NVL(orders.salesman_id,0) AS "Employee Number", 
        TO_CHAR(ROUND(SUM(ord.total),2), '$99,999,999.99') AS "Total Sale"

        ORDER BY order_id) ord
INNER JOIN orders
ON ord.order_id = orders.order_id
GROUP BY orders.salesman_id
ORDER BY NVL(orders.salesman_id,0) ASC;

-- *Question#3* Display customer ID, customer name and total number of orders for customers that the value of their customer ID is in values from 35 to 45. 
-- Include the customers with no orders in your report if their customer ID falls in the range 35 and 45. Sort the result by the value of total orders.
-- Q3 SOLUTION 
SELECT customers.customer_id AS "Customer ID", 
        customers.name AS "Customer Name",

-- *Question#5* Display customer Id, name, total number of orders, the total number of items ordered, and the total order amount for customers who have more than 30 orders. 
-- Sort the result based on the total number of orders.
-- Q5 SOLUTION 
SELECT customers.customer_id AS "Customer ID", 
        customers.name AS "Customer Name", 
        COUNT(orders.order_id) AS "Total Number of Orders",
        SUM(order_items.quantity) AS "Total Items",

-- *Question#7* Display the total number of orders per month. Sort the result from January to December.
-- Q7 SOLUTION 
SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(EXTRACT(month FROM order_date),'MM'), 'Month') AS "Month",

FROM orders
GROUP BY EXTRACT(month FROM order_date) 
ORDER BY EXTRACT(month FROM order_date);

-- *Question#8* Display product ID, product name for products that their list price is more than any highest product standard cost per warehouse outside Americas regions.
